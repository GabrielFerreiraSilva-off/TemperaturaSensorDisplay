# TemperaturaSensorDisplay
This repository contains a project I did in an IoT course. It consists of a DHT22 sensor, which receives data, displays it on the display and sends it to Thingspeak. It was divided into modules, with the one that controls the display with functions created for easy communication with the display, in addition to the Thingspeak module, which connects to Thingspeak and sends the data. The modules were made with scalability in mind, so they do not depend on fixed values, as they use the values passed by the main.py file. Feel free to use them as long as you give due credit.
